Teach, also known as "Blackbeard", who stole it from Commander Thatch of the Whitebeard Pirates' 4th division after murdering him. This devil fruit can create huge darkness vortexes in which it can suck anything. The biggest strength of this fruit is that it can stop other devil fruits from working by sucking their power. It has one weakness. You feel 10 times more pain, but for a strong user, this shouldn't be the biggest problem.</p>

   <h2>How do zoans rank among devil fruit types?</h2>

   <hr>

   <p>Zoan fruits are probably the most stable devil fruit type. They are very strong and also give stong new abilities and fast regeneration time. I think that pretimeskip they are the weakest type, but now, they are mostly equal with paramecias. The mithical zoans on the other hand are probably the strongest devil fruits.</p>

   <h3><b>3. The Tori Tori no mi, Model: Pheonix</b></h3>

   <hr>

   <p>The Tori Tori no Mi, Model: Phoenix is a Mythical Zoan-type Devil Fruit which bestows the power to transform into a phoenix (and phoenix hybrid) at will. It was eaten by Marco. Most significantly, the user can create their "Blue Flames of Resurrection" , English version: Blue Flame of Revival), also called "Flames of Regeneration". These light-blue flames enshroud the user when they transform, though the latter is not necessary for the flames to be conjured. Generally, while the blue flames do not burn, spread, or exude heat like normal flames do, their "special" nature makes them more potent than normal fire, proven when Marco overpowered and caused pain to Prometheus, a "special" fire homie made from Big Mom's soul. </p>

   <p>Hito Hito No Mi, Model: Nika is a mythical zoan devil fruit which is currently possessed by Monkey D Luffy. It enables the user to get the powers of Sun God Nika (A.K.A Warrior of Liberation) and it gives the user a rubber like body. It's powers is limited by the user's imagination. It can turn everything it touches to have/be very rubbery or elastic properties. It can also produce any elements like lightning, fire, and ice if the user wants to. It can also make the user to be bigger or smaller.</p>

   <hr>

   <p>The Doku Doku no Mi has toxic powers that have the potential to instantly end anyone’s life. The user of this paramecia-type devil fruit has the ability to produce and control any kind of poison found on the entire planet. It is another devil fruit with poisonous powers that shouldn’t be meddled with. If the opponent doesn’t have an antidote, it’s game over for them. This fruit was eaten by the Impel Down warden, Magellan.</p>

   <hr>

   <p>The Mochi Mochi no Mi devil fruit enables the user to entirely transform into Mochi (Japanese rice cake) and manufacture it at will. This devil fruit power may not seem to be as potent on paper, but Katakuri made the most out of it and expertly displayed the capabilities you get with this special devil fruit. It is a paramecia devil fruit but the powers are definitely logia-like; which is why it is considered to be the only special paramecia devil fruit in One Piece.</p>

   <h3><b>3. Zushi Zushi no Mi, Press Press Fruit</b></h3>

   <hr>

   <p>One of the deadliest but underappreciated devil fruits is Fujitora’s Zushi Zushi no Mi. This devil fruit enables the user to create and control gravitational forces. For instance, the user can perform telekinetic-like actions such as pushing things or people front and back or levitating them up in midair at will. It is one of the most terrifying devil fruits as it has the capacity to destroy the world. </p>

   <h3><b>2. Gura Gura no Mi, Tremor Tremor Fruit</b></h3>

   <hr>

   <p>Inarguably due to its utterly devastating abilities, the Gura Gura no Mi is regarded as the strongest Paramecia devil fruit of all time. As Marine Admiral Sengoku stated, this demon fruit indeed has the ability to end the planet, and its abilities are well-known worldwide. It is terrifying how capable this devil fruit can produce earthquakes or shockwaves that can travel through any medium. Furthermore, in hand-to-hand combat, this devil fruit user can employ his seismic tactics to cause great damage. This fruit was in the hands of Whitebeard before Blackbeard managed to misteriously get it's powers.</p>

   <hr>

   <p>Coming in first is Trafalgar Law’s Ope Ope no Mi, the most versatile devil fruit in the One Piece world. This paramecia-devil fruit has a unique ability not found in any other devil fruit, that of granting another person everlasting youth in return for the devil fruit user’s own life. This fruit’s powers include the ability to construct a dome area called “Room” and to freely control everything or anybody inside of it like a surgeon. Furthermore, this user can pull off miracles and cure incurable illnesses with the powers of this devil fruit. It is currently used by Trafalgar D. Water Law.</p>
